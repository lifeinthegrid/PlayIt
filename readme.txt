PlayIt puts all your media resources into a clean, simple and easy to use interface.
The easy to edit XML configuration file allows you to rapidly build your own media library. 

== QUICK START ==

Note:
	- PlayIt only works from an  "http(s)://" path do not try "file:///"
	- The demos currently make references to Google’s CDN network which requires internet access
	- To see the plugin extract the zip file to a location on your web server then browse to index.html

Steps:
	1. Extract the PlayIt archive to a location on your web server which must be http(s).
	2. Browse to http://your-server/path-to-playit/jquery.playit/demo/data-pro/quick-start.html
	3. In a text editor open quick-start.xml and begin changing your values
	4. Be sure the cacheXml parameter is set to false until you complete with setup
	5. When moving quick-start (xml & html) to a new directory update all relative paths in each file


== CHANGELOG ==

= 1.0  =
